# ACNH Compendium (iOS)
This is the final project for my iOS development class.
This project was developed in XCode using Swift and is compatible on both mobile and tablet.

### Functionality
This app allows a user to browse Animal Crossing New Horizons villagers. They can create, edit, and delete custom lists and add villagers to them.

They can also toggle reminders for a villager's birthday, and the app also features a BINGO game which can be played while villager hunting.
